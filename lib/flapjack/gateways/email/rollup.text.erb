Hi <%= @contact_first_name %>

You have <%= @rollup_alerts.length %> alerting check<%= @rollup_alerts.length == 1 ? '' : 's' %> as follows:

<% @rollup_alerts.sort_by {|entity_check, details| details['duration'] }.each do |rollup_alert| -%>
<%   r_entity, r_check = rollup_alert[0].split(':', 2) -%>
<%   state    = rollup_alert[1]['state'] -%>
<%   duration = ChronicDuration.output(rollup_alert[1]['duration']) -%>
  * <%= r_check %> on <%= r_entity %> is <%= ['ok'].include?(state) ? state.upcase : state.titleize %> (<%= duration %>)
<% end -%>

<% if @rollup.downcase == 'recovery' -%>
As your email summary threshold is <%= @rollup_threshold %>, we're taking your email alerts out of summary mode now. You'll now be emailed individually for each alerting check.
<% else -%>
Your email alerts are being summarised as your email summary threshold is set to <%= @rollup_threshold %>. You'll receive summary emails like this one until your number of alerting checks falls below <%= @rollup_threshold %>.
<% end -%>

Cheers,
Flapjack
