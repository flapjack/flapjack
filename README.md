Flapjack is a highly scalable and distributed monitoring notification system.

Flapjack provides a scalable method for dealing with events representing changes in system state (OK -> WARNING -> CRITICAL transitions) and alerting appropriate people as necessary.

At its core, flapjack process events received from external check execution engines, such as Nagios. Nagios provides a 'perfdata' event output channel, which writes to a named pipe. `flapjack-nagios-receiver` then reads from this named pipe, converts each line to JSON and adds them to the events queue. Flapjack's `executive` component picks up the events and processes them -- deciding when and who to notifify about problems, recoveries, acknowledgements etc. Additional check engines can be supported by adding additional receiver processes similar to the nagios receiver.
